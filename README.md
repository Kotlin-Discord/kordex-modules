# Template

This repository provides a template that should be used to create any other
new repositories under the Kotlin Discord organisation. It mostly exists
to extend the centralised configuration in the `.github` repository, and to
provide a few basic files.

If you use this repository as a template, please remember to rewrite this
file to suit the project!
