# KordEx Modules

independent, and you can make use of them in your own Kord Extensions bots with minimal effort.

# In progress!

# Licensing Notes

* `ext-mappings`: The Mappings extension makes use of [linkie-core](https://github.com/shedaniel/linkie-core), and
  contains code adapted from [linkie-discord](https://github.com/shedaniel/linkie-discord). Both projects are licensed
  under the Apache License 2.0, which you can find in [LICENSE-linkie.md](LICENSE-linkie.md), distributed within the
  `ext-mappings` JAR, on [the linkie-core GitHub](https://github.com/shedaniel/linkie-core/blob/master/LICENSE.md) or
  on [the linkie-discord GitHub](https://github.com/shedaniel/linkie-discord/blob/master/LICENSE.md). Both
  `linkie-core` and `linkie-discord` are property of [shedaniel](https://github.com/shedaniel).
